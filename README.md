# nsensfel's git-submodules
Felt like the official Git submodules implementation was very awkward to use and
that submodules aren't exactly that complicated to implement anyway.

This program provides something similar to Git submodules, except that
submodules of a repository are only described in `.gitsubmodules` and that a
submodule can have multiple sources.

This is more of a proof of concept than anything serious.
